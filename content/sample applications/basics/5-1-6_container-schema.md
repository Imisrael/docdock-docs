5.1.6 Schema definition
=======================

Overview
--------

This chapter describes the schema definition and data types.

  

Schema definition
-----------------

Data of the measuring instruments and instrument log that will be handled in this sample application are defined in the container as follows.

**Table.1 Container Information**

  

| Data                 | Container type       | Quantity         | Container name                                | Row key               |
|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Measuring instrument | Collection           | 1                | weather_station                               | Instrument ID         |
| Instrument log       | TimeSeries Container | 1 per instrument | weather_station_  (Example:weather_station_1) | Logging date and time |

One collection will be created with rows corresponding to different measuring instruments..  
One TimeSeries container will be created as the instrument log for each measuring instrument.  
The instrument ID to will be included in the instrument log's container name.

There are two ways to use Container in your programs.  
One is to pre-define the class statically which represents a row of the container.  
The other is to create a Container dynamically without preparing the pre-defined class.  
Here we describe only the static method, so please refer to [Meta-information](5-1-22_metainfo.php) for more details about dynamic method.

**List.1 Measuring instrument class**(WeatherStation.java)

package sample.row;

import com.toshiba.mwcloud.gs.RowKey;

/\*\*
 \* Class that represents the definition of the schema.
 */
public class WeatherStation {
    /\*\*
     \* ID of WeatherStation
     */
    @RowKey
    public String id;

    /\*\*
     \* Name of WeatherStation
     */
    public String name;

    /\*\*
     \* Installation Latitude
     */
    public double latitude;

    /\*\*
     \* Installation Longitude
     */
    public double longitude;

    /\*\*
     \* Camera exists or not
     */
    public boolean hasCamera;
}

*   L.12: The `@RowKey` annotates the field to be used as a row key.

  

**List.2 Instrument log class**(InstrumentLog.java)

package sample.row;

import java.sql.Blob;
import java.util.Date;

import com.toshiba.mwcloud.gs.RowKey;

/\*\*
 \* Class that represents the definition of the Row of Instrument log.
 */
public class InstrumentLog {
    /\*\*
     \* Timestamp of log
     */
    @RowKey
    public Date timestamp;

    /\*\*
     \* ID of Weather Station
     */
    public String weatherStationId;

    /\*\*
     \* Temperature of the measurement result
     */
    public float temperture;

    /\*\*
     \* Image data obtained by photographing the sky
     */
    public Blob liveImage;
}

*   L.15: The `@RowKey` annotates the field to be used as a row key.

  

Column Data Types
-----------------

The following types of data can be used in a GridDB column.

**Table.2 Available column type**

  

| Column Type | Type in Program    | Description                                                                             |
|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOOL        | boolean or Boolean | TRUE or FALSE.                                                                          |
| STRING      | String             | Zero or more Unicode characters excluding the NULL character (U+0000).                  |
| BYTE        | Byte or byte       | Integer value in the following range.(-2^7 to 2^7-1)                                    |
| SHORT       | Short or short     | Integer value in the following range.(-2^15 to 2^15-1)                                  |
| INTEGER     | Integer or int     | Integer value in the following range.(-2^31 to 2^31-1)                                  |
| LONG        | Long or long       | Integer value in the following range.(-2^63 to 2^63-1)                                  |
| FLOAT       | Float or float     | Single-precision floating point number.                                                 |
| DOUBLE      | Double or double   | Double-precision floating point number.                                                 |
| TIMESTAMP   | java.util.Date     | Combination of a date and time consisting of year, month, day, hour, minute and second. |
| BLOB        | java.sql.Blob      | Binary data.                                                                            |

All types except `BLOB` can be stored as an array.

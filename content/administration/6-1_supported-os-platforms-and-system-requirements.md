### Supported Environments

The following Linux distributions are tested and will work with GridDB

*   OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 / 6.3 / 6.4 / 6.5 (x86_64)
*   CentOS 6.2 / 6.3 / 6.4 / 6.5 (x86_64)

### Hardware Requirements

As GridDB is a scale-out database, it is easy to add more machines to the cluster to increase both computing power and storage space simultaneously. Some basic hardware requirements look like this:

*   Memory: 32GB+
*   Disk: 100GB+

### Network Requirements

There are no strict network requirements to use GridDB. The only caveat that exists is that the cluster must be able to communicate via Multicast networking for use with the Community Edition.
